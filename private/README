The private/ folder contains various stuff that I use
when developing and testing python-gpsdshm. It's called
private because most of it is very specific to my setup
and probably won't make much sense anywhere else. 

You are welcome to use anything you find here but it will
be completely unsupported. It may even stuff up your 
computer.
